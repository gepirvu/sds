My name is Georgian Pirvu. I'm a Cloud Data Engineering Lead and certified Azure and Databricks expert, with a strong track record of designing scalable cloud and AI platforms across Germany and Switzerland.

I’ve spent the last decade building and modernizing cloud-native Data & AI platforms for over 13 companies, from global enterprises like Daimler and Axpo to fast-paced consultancies. I specialize in infrastructure-as-code (Terraform, Bicep), production-grade data pipelines on Azure and Databricks, and deploying clean architectures that align tightly with business goals.

At Axpo Solutions, I led Azure infrastructure strategy and delivered over 20 impactful projects, while shaping internal products now used org-wide. I care deeply about speed and quality — helping teams ship fast while maintaining technical excellence and governance.

Outside of my 9–5, I’m a passionate advocate for sharing knowledge. You’ll find my articles on Medium, speaking sessions at events like Microsoft Reactor London, and contributions to the Databricks Champion community in Germany.

My background? I hold a Master’s in Mathematical Modeling in Finance. I’m 5x Azure certified, 2x Databricks certified, and just slightly obsessed with AI, cloud economics, and clean architecture. I also speak four languages (Romanian, English, German, Spanish) and never say no to a good espresso or a gym session.

Most people call me George — just don’t ask me to stop tweaking CI/CD pipelines on the weekend.

Let’s build something that lasts.
