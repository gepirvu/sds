      "- **CI/CD Pipeline Integration:** The modules are designed to be integrated within CI/CD pipelines, enabling automated and repeatable infrastructure deployments.\n",
      "- **Production-Ready Modules and Blueprints:** The project offers access to rigorously tested, production-ready modules, services, and blueprints that comply with organizational Azure Policies and security standards.\n",
      "- **Governance and Compliance:** Modules are tested against Azure Policies defined by the Security Team to ensure compliance and security.\n",
