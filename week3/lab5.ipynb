       "## 1. Introduction  \n",
       "The field of artificial intelligence (AI) continues to innovate at a remarkable pace. In May 2025, AI agent frameworks have become integral to the development of intelligent systems, facilitating complex task execution, enhancing operational efficiency, and improving user experience across various sectors. This report reviews the most popular and successful AI agent frameworks as of May 2025, discusses their unique features, and outlines their applications and implications for the future.  \n",
       "\n",
       "## 2. Overview of AI Agent Frameworks in 2025  \n",
       "Numerous AI frameworks have emerged, each targeting specific aspects of AI development. Below are the leading frameworks:\n",
       "\n",
       "### 2.1 LangChain  \n",
       "LangChain has established itself as a versatile Python framework for building large language model (LLM) applications, including AI agents. Its modular architecture allows for the creation of complex workflows by integrating diverse tools, APIs, and memory management capabilities. This feature makes LangChain particularly adaptable for developers aiming to build customized AI applications. With a supportive community, it remains a primary choice for sophisticated AI development.  \n",
       "\n",
       "### 2.2 AutoGen  \n",
       "Developed by Microsoft, AutoGen emphasizes multi-agent orchestration, allowing AI agents to communicate naturally. This framework includes various built-in agents and a user-friendly graphical interface for prototype development. Particularly effective in domains requiring dynamic interactions among agents, AutoGen caters to applications ranging from automated customer service to collaborative research tasks.  \n",
       "\n",
       "### 2.3 CrewAI  \n",
       "CrewAI introduces a role-based design focusing on collaboration among AI agents. This lightweight Python framework is tailored for structured teamwork, making it ideal for scenarios like project management or marketing automation. Its user-friendly setup lowers the barrier to entry for teams wanting to implement AI-driven initiatives.  \n",
